        Create a Java class named SimpleAuthentication.
            In the main method:
            Prompt the user to enter their username.
                Use Scanner to capture the entered username.
            Prompt the user to enter their password.
                Use Scanner to capture the entered password.


            Check if entered credentials are correct:
            Use an if-else statement to compare the entered username and password with the correct ones.
                If both username and password match, print a welcome message.
                If both username and password do not match, print an "Incorrect username and password. Access denied." message.
                If only the username does not match, print an "Incorrect username. Access denied." message.
                If only the password does not match, print an "Incorrect password. Access denied." message.
